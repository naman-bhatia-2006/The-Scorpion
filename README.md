Hexapod robot with 6 dof using ros2

Hi, I am Naman Bhatia a 2nd year Electrical engineering student at IIT Mandi.
In this project, I am trying to create and simulate a hexapod robot in ros2 (and make it in real world if i get the funds).

A hexapod robot has a main body abd 6 legs, each with 3 revolute joints and 2 links. Each leg has 3 dof and the total dof of the robot is 6.
